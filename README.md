open-quantum-safe/openssl - OQS fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1
=====================================================

**OpenSSL** is an open-source TLS/SSL and crypto library [https://openssl.org/](https://openssl.org/).  ([View the original README file for OpenSSL](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/blob/master/README).)

This branch is a fork of OpenSSL 1.1.1 that adds the following:

- post-quantum key exchange in TLS 1.3
- hybrid (post-quantum + elliptic curve) key exchange in TLS 1.3
- post-quantum authentication in TLS 1.3

Overview
--------

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms.  See more about liboqs at [https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/), including a list of supported algorithms.

**open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into OpenSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography.  The integration should not be considered "production quality".

More information on OQS can be found on our website: [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org/).

open-quantum-safe/openssl branch OQS-OpenSSL\_1\_1\_1-stable
------------------------------------------------------------

This branch ([OQS-OpenSSL\_1\_1\_1-stable branch](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable)) integrates post-quantum key exchange from liboqs in TLS 1.3 in OpenSSL v1.1.1.  

(For TLS 1.2, see the [OQS-OpenSSL\_1\_0\_2-stable](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl/tree/OQS-OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable) branch.)

### Key exchange mechanisms

The following key exchange / key encapsulation mechanisms from liboqs are supported (assuming they have been enabled in liboqs):

- `bike1l1`, `bike1l3`, `bike1l5`, `bike3l1`, `bike3l3`, `bike3l5` (not currently on Windows)
- `frodo640aes`, `frodo640cshake`, `frodo976aes`, `frodo976cshake`
- `newhope512cca`, `newhope1024cca`
- `sidh503`, `sidh751`
- `sike503`, `sike751`

### Authentication mechanisms

The following signature schemes from liboqs are supported:

- `picnicL1FS`
- `qteslaI`, `qteslaIIIsize`, `qteslaIIIspeed` (not currently on Windows)

Limitations and security
------------------------

liboqs and our integration into OpenSSL are designed for prototyping and evaluating quantum-resistant cryptography.  Security of proposed quantum-resistant algorithms may rapidly change as research advances, and may ultimately be completely insecure against either classical or quantum computers.

We believe that the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project is currently the best avenue to identifying potentially quantum-resistant algorithms.  liboqs does not intend to "pick winners", and we strongly recommend that applications and protocols rely on the outcomes of the NIST standardization project when deploying post-quantum cryptography.

We acknowledge that some parties may want to begin deploying post-quantum cryptography prior to the conclusion of the NIST standardization project.  We strongly recommend that any attempts to do make use of so-called **hybrid cryptography**, in which post-quantum public-key algorithms are used alongside traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) so that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.

liboqs and our integration into OpenSSL is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.  See [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) for the full disclaimer.

The integration of liboqs into our fork of OpenSSL is currently at an experimental stage, and has not received significant review.  At this stage, we do not recommend relying on it in any production environment or to protect any sensitive data.

The OQS fork of OpenSSL is not endorsed by the OpenSSL project.

Proofs of TLS such as [[JKSS12]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/219) and [[KPW13]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/339) require a key exchange mechanism that has a form of active security, either in the form of the PRF-ODH assumption, or an IND-CCA KEM.  Some of the KEMs provided in liboqs do provide IND-CCA security; others do not, in which case existing proofs of security of TLS against active attackers do not apply.

Currently, this branch supports post-quantum and hybrid (traditional + post-quantum) key exchange and post-quantum-only authentication in TLS 1.3.  We intend to add support for hybrid authentication in TLS 1.3 and post-quantum/hybrid key exchange and authentication in TLS 1.2.

Lifecycle for open-quantum-safe/openssl branch OQS-OpenSSL\_1\_1\_1-stable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Release cycle:** We aim to make releases of OQS-OpenSSL\_1\_1\_1-stable shortly after releases of OpenSSL 1.1.1-stable.

**Algorithm deprecation:** If an algorithm in liboqs is found to be insecure or does not advance to the next round of the NIST competition, it may be removed.  See the [liboqs README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md) for more information about the deprecation lifecycle.

**Algorithm compatibility:** Unlike existing standardization cryptographic algorithms (SHA-2, SHA-3, PKCS\#1v1.5, nistp256, ...), post-quantum algorithms are under active development, and the mathematical algorithm of a cryptographic scheme may change: a particular name (e.g., "FrodoKEM-AES-640") may refer to different mathematical algorithms over time.  liboqs may update implementations as algorithms evolve. See the [liboqs README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md) for more information about the deprecation lifecycle.

Building on Linux and macOS
---------------------------

Builds have been tested on macOS 10.14 (clang), Ubuntu 14.04.5 (gcc-6), and Ubuntu 18.04.1 (gcc-7).

### Step 0: Install dependencies

For **Ubuntu**, you need to install the following packages:

	sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool gcc libssl-dev unzip xsltproc

For **macOS**, you need to install the following packages using brew (or a package manager of your choice):

	brew install autoconf automake libtool openssl wget

### Step 1: Download fork of OpenSSL

Clone or download the source from Github:

    git clone --branch OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl.git

### Step 2: Build liboqs

You must use the [master branch](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md) of liboqs with the OQS-OpenSSL\_1\_1\_1-stable branch.

The following instructions will download and build that branch of liboqs, then install it into a subdirectory inside the OpenSSL folder.

    git clone --branch master https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
    cd liboqs
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=<path-to-openssl-dir>/oqs --enable-shared=no --enable-openssl --with-openssl-dir=<path-to-system-openssl-dir>
    make clean
    make -j
    make install
    cd ..
    
On **Ubuntu**, `<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` is probably `/usr`.  On **macOS** with brew, `<path-to-system-openssl-dir>` is probably `/usr/local/opt/openssl`.

### Step 3: Build fork of OpenSSL

Now we follow the standard instructions for building OpenSSL.

For **Ubuntu**:

    cd <path-to-openssl-dir>
    ./Configure no-shared linux-x86_64 -lm
    make -j
    
For **macOS**:

    cd <path-to-openssl-dir>
    ./Configure no-shared darwin64-x86_64-cc
    make -j
    
Building on Windows
-------------------

Builds have been tested on Windows 10 (VS2017 build tools). Make sure you can build the unmodified version of OpenSSL by following the instructions in INSTALL and NOTES.WIN.

### Step 1: Download fork of OpenSSL

Clone or download the source from Github:

    git clone --branch OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl.git

### Step 2: Build liboqs

Next, you must download and build liboqs using the master branch of liboqs.  The following instructions will download and build that branch of liboqs, then copy the required files it into a subdirectory inside the OpenSSL folder.  You may need to install dependencies before building liboqs; see the [liboqs README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/master/README.md).

    git clone --branch master https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
    cd liboqs
    msbuild VisualStudio\liboqs.sln
    mkdir ..\openssl\oqs
    mkdir ..\openssl\oqs\lib
    mkdir ..\openssl\oqs\include
    xcopy VisualStudio\x64\Release\oqs.lib ..\openssl\oqs\lib\
    xcopy /S VisualStudio\include ..\openssl\oqs\include\

### Step 3: Build fork of OpenSSL

Now we follow the standard instructions for building OpenSSL, for example

    cd ..\openssl
    perl Configure VC-WIN64A
    nmake

Running
-------

See the [liboqs Github site](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) for information on test programs in liboqs.

### TLS demo

OpenSSL contains a basic TLS server (`s_server`) and TLS client (`s_client`) which can be used to demonstrate and test SSL/TLS connections.

To run a server, we first need to generate a self-signed X.509 certificate, using either a classical or post-quantum algorithm. Run the following command, with `<SIGALG>` = `rsa`, `picnicl1fs`, `qteslaI`, `qteslaIIIsize`, `qteslaIIIspeed`):

	apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey <SIGALG> -keyout <SIGALG>.key -out <SIGALG>.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest" -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf
	
If you want an ECDSA certificate (`<SIGALG>` = `ecdsa`), you need to use:

	apps/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey ec:<(apps/openssl ecparam -name secp384r1) -keyout <SIGALG>.key -out <SIGALG>.crt -nodes -subj "/CN=oqstest" -days 365 -config apps/openssl.cnf

To run a basic TLS server with all OQS ciphersuites enabled:

	apps/openssl s_server -cert <SIGALG>.crt -key <SIGALG>.key -www -tls1_3

In another terminal window, you can run a TLS client for any or all of the supported ciphersuites (`<KEXALG>` = `bike1l1`, `bike1l3`, `bike1l5`, `bike3l1`, `bike3l3`, `bike3l5`, `frodo640aes`, `frodo640cshake`, `frodo976aes`, `frodo976cshake`, `newhope512cca`, `newhope1024cca`, `sidh503`, `sidh751`, `sike503`, `sike751`) or the hybrid ciphersuites (`p256-<KEXALG>`, only the NIST p256 curve in combination with L1 PQC schemes are supported for now), for example:

    apps/openssl s_client -curves <KEXALG> -connect localhost:4433

Contributing
------------

Follow these steps to add additional key exchange and signature algorithms from liboqs.

One goal is to minimize the OQS footprint into the OpenSSL code, to improve readability. Therefore, some redundant code is implemented using macros to avoid creating functions and registering them in OpenSSL.

### Adding a key exchange algorithm

The TLS 1.3 key exchange integration is done at the TLS layer (start looking in `ssl/statem/extensions_(clnt,srvr).c`). It would have been nice to integrate in the crypto EVP layer, but it wasn't possible given the asymmetric nature of the KEM API (genkey, encrypt, decrypt) and the lack of role context when the Diffie-Hellman EVP functions are invoked. To add a new algorithm, run `grep -r ADD_MORE_OQS_KEM_HERE` and add new code following the example of other OQS schemes.

### Adding an authentication mechanism

To add a new algorithm <NEWALG> with OID <NEWOID>:

1. Define `<NEWOID>` in `crypto/objects/objects.txt`, add `<NEWALG>` to `crypto/objects/obj_mac.num`, incrementing the last NID value, and run `make generate_crypto_objects` to re-generate objects-related files (`obj_dat.h`, `obj_mac.num`, `obj_mac.h`)
2. Run `grep -r ADD_MORE_OQS_SIG_HERE` and add new code following the example of other OQS schemes.
